          <h2>Hi! I'm John</h2>  
            <p>I am a former technical sales representative living in Chicago, Illinois. As I continue my journey through Thinkful, I will update this page with projects that I have worked on and skills that I have developed. Hopefully, by the end of this course, I will have proved myself as a worthy addition to your company. I believe that my sales history and my new software developer skillset make me a unique candidate.</p>
            <p>In the last ten years of my professional life, I have built many relationships with potential customers and earned their business. Furthermore, I worked with a diverse team of service technicians, engineers, and factory reps. We all brought our unique skill sets together to deliver a custom product tailored to our customers' needs.</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>  
          <p>I have always been passionate about technology and computers, and coding mainlines that reward center of my brain. Since I was a teenager, I have been writing songs with other artists that began as ideas and then grew into a structure made up of chord changes and lyrics. Coding is very similar to me. Sure, some rules must be followed, but the potential for creativity is limitless. Like I worked with my former bandmates, I can't wait to collaborate with other developers!</p>

          <p>In addition to writing music, I also enjoy spending time with my wife & daughter, playing video games, and discussing movies.</p>
